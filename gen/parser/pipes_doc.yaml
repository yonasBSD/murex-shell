     `->` Arrow Pipe
  CategoryID: parser
  SubCategoryIDs: [ parser.pipes ]
  Summary: >-
    Pipes stdout from the left hand command to stdin of the right hand command
  Description: |-
    This token behaves much like pipe would in Bash or similar shells. It passes
    stdout along the pipeline while merging stderr stream with the parents stderr
    stream.

    `->` differs from `|` in the interactive terminal where it produces different
    autocompletion suggestion. It returns a list of "methods". That is, commands
    that are known to support the output type of the previous command. `->` helps
    with the discovery of command line tools.

    In shell scripts, `->` and `|` can be used interchangeably.
  Examples: |-
    ### Piping stdout

    ```
    » out Hello, world! -> regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!

    » out Hello, world!->regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!
    ```

    ### Piping stderr

    In following example the first command is writing to stderr rather than stdout
    so `Hello, world!` doesn't get pipelined and thus isn't affected by `regexp`:
    
    ```
    » err Hello, world! -> regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!
    ```

    To pipe stderr you'd need to use the `<!>` syntax. For example `<!out>` to
    write stderr to stdout:

    ```
    » err <!out> Hello, world! -> regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!
    ```

  Title: >-
    `?` stderr Pipe
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Pipes stderr from the left hand command to stdin of the right hand command (DEPRECATED)
  Description: |-
    This token swaps the stdout and stderr streams of the left hand command.

    Please note that this token is only effective when it is prefixed by white
    space.

    > This feature has been deprecated. Please use `<err> <!out>` instead. For example:
    > ```
    > command <err> <!out> parameter-1 parameter-2 -> next-command parameter-1
    > ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » err Hello, world! ? regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!
    ```

    In following example the first command is writing to stdout rather than stderr
    so `Hello, world!` doesn't get pipelined and thus isn't affected by `regexp`:
    
    ```
    » out Hello, world! ? regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!
    ```

    In following example the stderr token isn't whitespace padded so is treated
    like any ordinary printable character:

    ```
    » err Hello, world!? regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!? regexp s/world/Earth/
    ```

  Title: >-
    `=>` Generic Pipe
  CategoryID: parser
  SubCategoryIDs: [ parser.pipes ]
  Summary: >-
    Pipes a reformatted stdout stream from the left hand command to stdin of the
    right hand command
  Description: |-
    This token behaves much like the `|` pipe would except it injects `format
    generic` into the pipeline. The purpose of a formatted pipe is to support
    piping out to external commands which don't support Murex data types. For
    example they might expect arrays as lists rather than JSON objects).
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » ja [Mon..Wed] => cat
    Mon
    Tue
    Wed
    ```

    The above is literally the same as typing:

    ```
    » ja [Mon..Wed] -> format generic -> cat
    Mon
    Tue
    Wed
    ```

    To demonstrate how the previous pipeline might look without a formatted pipe:
    
    ```
    » ja [Mon..Wed] -> cat
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

    » ja [Mon..Wed] | cat
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

    » ja [Mon..Wed]
    [
        "Mon",
        "Tue",
        "Wed"
    ]
    ```

  Summary: >-
    Pipes stdout from the left hand command to stdin of the right hand command
  Description: |-
    This token behaves much like pipe would in Bash or similar shells. It passes
    stdout along the pipeline while merging stderr stream with the parents stderr
    stream.

    It can be used interchangeably with the arrow pipe, `->`, in shell scripts.
  Examples: |-
    ### Piping stdout

    ```
    » out Hello, world! | regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!

    » out Hello, world!|regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!
