  Description: |-
    `key-code` is a tool used for querying what byte sequence the terminal emulator
  Usage: |-

  Examples: |-
    ### Typical use case

    ...then press [f9] and `key-code` returns...

    ```

    ```

    ### As a method

    ```

    ### Redirection

    If stdout is not a TTY then only the thing written is the ANSI Constant. This
    is so that it can be used as a variable. eg

    ```
    key-code -> set $key

    event onKeyPress close=$key {
        exit
    }
    ```
