    YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)
  Description: |-
    YAML support within Murex is pretty mature however it is not considered a
    primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
    expect in most deployments of Murex, it's still an optional package and
    thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
    external source packages for the shell to compile.
  Usage:
  Examples:
  Hooks:
    ReadArray(): Works with YAML arrays. Maps are converted into arrays
    ReadArrayWithType(): Works with YAML arrays. Maps are converted into arrays. Element type returned in Murex should match element type in YAML
    ReadMap(): Works with YAML maps
    WriteArray(): Works with YAML arrays
    ReadIndex(): Works against all properties in YAML
    ReadNotIndex(): Works against all properties in YAML
    Marshal(): Supported
    Unmarshal(): Supported
