    Output String, stdout: `out`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs:
    - commands.io

  Summary: >-
    Print a string to the stdout with a trailing new line character
  Description: |-
    Write parameters to stdout with a trailing new line character.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    out string to write -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### out

    ```
    » out Hello, World!
    Hello, World!
    ```

    ### echo

    For compatibility with other shells (and POSIX), `echo` is also supported:

    ```
    » echo Hello, World!
    Hello, World!
    ```
  Detail: |-
    `out` / `echo` output as `string` data-type. This can be changed by casting
    (`cast`) or using the `tout` function.

    ### ANSI Constants

    `out` supports ANSI constants.

    Output With Type Annotation: `tout`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.io ]
  Summary: >-
    Print a string to the stdout and set it's data-type
  Description: |-
    Write parameters to stdout without a trailing new line character. Cast the
    output's data-type to the value of the first parameter.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    tout data-type "string to write" -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » tout json { "Code": 404, "Message": "Page not found" } -> pretty
    {
        "Code": 404,
        "Message": "Page not found"
    }
    ```
  Detail: |-
    `tout` supports ANSI constants.

    Unlike `out`, `tout` does not append a carriage return / line feed.

    `(brace quote)`
  CategoryID: parser
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.io ]
  Summary: >-
    Write a string to the stdout without new line (deprecated)
  Description: |-
    Write parameters to stdout (does not include a new line)
  Usage: |-
    ```
    (string to write) -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » (Hello, World!)
    Hello, World!

    » (Hello,\nWorld!)
    Hello,
    World!

    » ((Hello,) (World!))
    (Hello,) (World!)

    # Print "Hello, World!" in red text
    » {RED}Hello, World!{RESET}
    Hello, World!
    ```
  Detail: |-
    The `(` function performs exactly like the `(` token for quoting so you do not
    need to escape other tokens (eg single / double quotes, `'`/`"`, nor curly
    braces, `{}`). However the braces are nestable so you will need to escape those
    characters if you don't want them nested.

    ### ANSI Constants

    `(` supports ANSI constants.

  Title: >+
    Error String, strerr: `err`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.io ]
  Summary: >-
    Print a line to the stderr
  Description: |-
    Write parameters to stderr with a trailing new line character.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    err string to write -> <stderr>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » err Hello, World!
    Hello, World!
    ```
  Detail: |-
    `err` outputs as `string` data-type. This can be changed by casting

    ```
    err { "Code": 404, "Message": "Page not found" } ? cast json
    ```

    However passing structured data-types along the stderr stream is not recommended
    as any other function within your code might also pass error messages along the
    same stream and thus taint your structured data. This is why Murex does not
    supply a `tout` function for stderr. The recommended solution for passing
    messages like these which you want separate from your stdout stream is to create
    a new Murex named pipe.

    ```
    » pipe --create messages
    » bg { <messages> -> pretty }
    » tout <messages> json { "Code": 404, "Message": "Page not found" }
    » pipe --close messages
    {
        "Code": 404,
        "Message": "Page not found"
    }
    ```
