  Summary: >-
    Lists or filters file system objects (eg files)
  Description: |-
    `f` lists or filters lists of file system objects, such as files, directories,
    etc. `f` provides a quick way to output file system items that confirm to
    specific criteria.

    You define this criteria by using +flags (eg `+s` for all symlinks) and
    optionally then restricting that criteria with -flags (eg `-x` to remove all
    executable items). All flags supported as `+` are also supported as a `-`.

    By default `f` will return no results. You need to include +flags.

    Output is a JSON array as this format preserves whitespace in file names.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    f options -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> f options -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Return only directories

    ```
    f +d
    ```

    ### Mixing inclusion and exclusions

    Return file and directories but exclude symlinks:

    ```
    f +fd -s
    ```

    ### As a method
    
    Filter out files in a list (eg created by `g`) using conditions set by `f`:

    ```
    g '*.go' -> f +f

    rx '\.(txt|md)' -> f +fw
    ```
  Flags:
    -: "exclude files (pair this with any other flag apart from `+`)"
    +: "include files (pair this with any other flag apart from `-`)"

    f: all files (inc symlinks, devices, sockets, name pipes, etc)
    F: regular files (exc symlinks, devices, sockets, named pipes, etc)
    d: all directories (inc symlinks)
    D: regular directories
    s: symlinks
    l: symlinks
    b: block devices
    c: character devices
    S: sockets
    p: POSIX named pipes (FIFO)
    i: irregular files (nothing else is known about these files)
    "?": deprecated -- use `i` instead

    r: read permissions (user, group, or other)
    R: user read permissions
    e: group read permissions
    E: other read permissions

    w: write permissions (user, group, or other)
    W: user write permissions
    q: group write permissions
    Q: other write permissions

    x: execute permissions (user, group, or other)
    X: user execute permissions
    z: group execute permissions
    Z: other execute permissions

  Detail: |-
    `+` flags are always matched first. Then the `-` flags are used to filter out
    any matches from the `+` flags.
