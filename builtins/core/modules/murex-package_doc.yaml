    ### `murex-package list`... `enabled` vs `loaded`

    `enabled` and `disabled` reads the package status from disk rather than the
    package cache in your current Murex session (like `runtime` reports). This
    because the typical use for `murex-package list enabled|disabled` is to view
    which packages and modules will be loaded with any new murex session.
    
    If you wish to view what modules are loaded in a current session then use
    `murex-package list loaded` instead. This is also equivalent to using
    `runtime --modules`.
