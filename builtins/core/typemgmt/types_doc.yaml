    Execute External Command: `exec`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.proc ]
  Summary: >-
    Runs an executable
  Description: |-
    With Murex, like most other shells, you launch a process by calling the
    name of that executable directly. While this is suitable 99% of the time,
    occasionally you might run into an edge case where that wouldn't work. The
    primary reason being if you needed to launch a process from a variable, eg

    ```
    » set exe=uname
    » $exe
    uname
    ```

    As you can see here, Murex's behavior here is to output the contents of
    the variable rather then executing the contents of the variable. This is
    done for safety reasons, however if you wanted to override that behavior
    then you could prefix the variable with exec:

    ```
    » set exe=uname
    » exec $exe
    Linux
    ```
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> exec

    <stdin> -> exec -> <stdout>

               exec -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### As a function

    ```
    » exec printf "Hello, world!"
    Hello, world!
    ```

    ### Working around aliases

    If you have an alias like `alias ls=ls --color=auto` and you wanted to run `ls`
    but without colour, you might run `exec ls`.
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    If any command doesn't exist as a builtin, function nor alias, then Murex
    will default to forking out to any command with this name (subject to an
    absolute path or the order of precedence in `$PATH`). Any forked process will
    show up in both the operating systems process viewer (eg `ps`) but also
    Murex's own process viewer, `fid-list`. However inside `fid-list` you will
    notice that all external processes are listed as `exec` with the process name
    as part of `exec`'s parameters. That is because `exec` is handler for programs
    that aren't native to Murex.

    ### Compatibility with POSIX

    For compatibility with traditional shells like Bash and Zsh, `command` is an
    alias for `exec`.

  Summary: >-

  Description: |-
    Terminate Murex with an exit number of 1.

    > This builtin has now been deprecated. The same behaviour can be achieved via

  Title: >+
    Exit Murex: `exit`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.lang ]
  Summary: >-
    Exit murex
  Description: |-
    Exit's Murex with either a exit number of 0 (by default if no parameters
    supplied) or a custom value specified by the first parameter.

    `exit` is not scope aware; if it is included in a function then the whole
    shell will still exist and not just that function.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    exit

    exit number
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » exit
    ```

    » exit 42

  Title: >+
    Null: `null`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.lang ]
  Summary: >-
    null function. Similar to /dev/null
  Description: |-
    `null` is a function that acts a little like the `null` data type and the
    UNIX /dev/null device.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> null
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » out "Hello, world!" -> null
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    While this method does exist, a more idiomatic way to suppress stdout is to
    use the named pipe property rather than piping to null:

    ```
    » out <null> "Hello, world!"
    ```

  - "null"

    Define Type: `cast`
  CategoryID: commands

  Summary: >-
    Alters the data-type of the previous function without altering its output
  Description: |-
    `cast` alters the data-type annotation for a pipe.
    
    The contents of the pipeline are preserved, only the reported data-type is
    changed.

    Additionally `cast` can be used to define the output type of a function.
  Usage: |-
    Changing type annotation for a pipe

    ```
    <stdin> -> cast data-type -> <stdout>

    <stdin> :data-type: command
    ```

    Defining the output type of a function

    ```
    cast data-type
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### As a command

    ```
    » out {"Array":[1,2,3],"Map":{"String": "Foobar","Number":123.456}} \
      -> cast json
    {"Array":[1,2,3],"Map":{"String": "Foobar","Number":123.456}}
    ```

    ### As a token

    ```
    » out {"Array":[1,2,3],"Map":{"String": "Foobar","Number":123.456}} \
      -> :json: cat
    {"Array":[1,2,3],"Map":{"String": "Foobar","Number":123.456}}
    ```

    ### Defining data-type

    ```
    » function example {
        cast json
        out '{"foo": "bar"}'
    }

    » example -> debug -> [[ /Data-Type/Murex ]]
    json
