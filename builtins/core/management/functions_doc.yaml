    Re-Scan $PATH For Executables
  SubCategoryIDs:
    - commands.shell
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Forces Murex to rescan $PATH looking for executables
  Description: |-
    On application launch, Murex scans and caches all the executables found in
    $PATH on your host. Murex then does regular scans there after. However if
    you want to force a new scan (for example you've just installed a new
    program and you want it to appear in tab completion) then you can run `murex-update-exe-list`.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    murex-update-exe-list
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » murex-update-exe-list
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    Murex will automatically update the exe list each time tab completion is
    invoked for command name completion via the REPL shell.

    Man-Page Summary: `man-summary`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs:
    - commands.help
  Summary: >-
    Outputs a man page summary of a command
  Description: |-
    `man-summary` reads the man pages for a given command(s) and outputs it's
    summary (if one exists).
  Usage: |-
    ```
    man-summary command [ commands ] -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » man-summary man 
    man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    `man-summary` can take multiple parameters and will return the summary for each
    command. If any commands have no summaries, then the exit number will be
    incremented. In the example below, two parameters had no associated man page:

    ```
    » man-summary aa ab ac ad ae
    aa - Manipulate Apple Archives
    ab - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool
    ac - connect time accounting
    ad - no man page exists
    ae - no man page exists
    
    » exitnum
    2

  Title: >+
    Change Directory: `cd`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs:
    - commands.posix
  Summary: >-
    Change (working) directory
  Description: |-
    Changes current working directory.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    cd [path]
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Home directory
    
    ```
    » cd ~
    ```

    Running `cd` without a parameter will also change to the current user's home
    directory:

    ```
    » cd
    ```

    ### Previous directory

    ```
    » cd -
    ```

    ### Absolute path
    
    ```
    » cd /etc/
    ```

    ### Relative path

    ```
    » cd Documents
    » cd ./Documents
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    ### $PWDHIST

    `cd` updates an environmental variable, `$PWDHIST` with an array of paths.
    You can then use that to change to a previous directory.

    #### View the working directory history
    
    ```
    » $PWDHIST
    ```

    #### Change to a previous directory
    
    ```
    » cd $PWDHIST[-1]
    ```

    > `cd -` is syntactic sugar for `$PWDHIST[-1]`

    ### auto-cd

    Some people prefer to omit `cd` and just write the path, with their shell
    automatically changing to that directory if the "command" is just a directory.
    In Murex you can enable this behaviour by turning on "auto-cd":

    ```
    config set shell auto-cd true
    ```

    Check Builtin Exists: `bexists`
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.proc ]
  Summary: >-
    Check which builtins exist
  Description: |-
    `bexists` takes an array of parameters and returns which commands have been
    compiled into Murex. The 'b' in `bexists` stands for 'builtins'
  Usage: |-
    ```
    bexists command... -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » bexists qr gzip runtime config
    {
        "Installed": [
            "runtime",
            "config"
        ],
        "Missing": [
            "qr",
            "gzip"
        ]
    }
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    This builtin dates back to the start of Murex when all of the builtins were
    considered optional. This was intended to be a way for scripts to determine
    which builtins were compiled. Since then `runtime` has absorbed and centralized
    a number of similar commands which have since been deprecated. The same fate
    might also happen to `bexists` however it is in use by a few modules and for
    that reason alone it has been spared from the axe.
