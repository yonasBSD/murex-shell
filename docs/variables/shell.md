# `SHELL` (str)

> Path of current shell

## Description

`SHELL` is an environmental variable containing the full path to the current
shell -- which in our case is Murex.

This variable is set by Murex to conform to POSIX standards. However, being an
environmental variable, it can be overwritten via `export`.

For Murex specific code, you are recommended to use `MUREX_EXE`, which is a
reserved variable, and thus read only, if you require precision and safety.
