# `LINES` (int)

> Character height of terminal

## Description

`LINES` returns the cell height of the terminal.

This is a [reserved variable](/docs/user-guide/reserved-vars.md) so it cannot be changed.

## Detail

The Murex controlling terminal is assumed to be the terminal. If Stdout cannot
be successfully queried for its dimensions, for example Murex is a piped rather
than controlling a TTY, then `$LINES` will generate an error:

```
Â» exec $MUREX_EXE -c 'out $LINES' -> cat
Error in `out` ( 1,1):
      Command: out $LINES
      Error: cannot assign value to $LINES: inappropriate ioctl for device
          > Expression: out $LINES
          >           :          ^
          > Character : 9
Error in `/Users/laurencemorgan/dev/go/src/github.com/lmorg/murex/murex` (0,1): exit status 1
```

This error can be caught via `||`, `try` et al.
