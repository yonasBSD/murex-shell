# `=>` Generic Pipe

> Pipes a reformatted stdout stream from the left hand command to stdin of the right hand command

## Description

This token behaves much like the `|` pipe would except it injects `format
generic` into the pipeline. The purpose of a formatted pipe is to support
piping out to external commands which don't support Murex data types. For
example they might expect arrays as lists rather than JSON objects).



## Examples

```
» ja [Mon..Wed] => cat
Mon
Tue
Wed
```

The above is literally the same as typing:

```
» ja [Mon..Wed] -> format generic -> cat
Mon
Tue
Wed
```

To demonstrate how the previous pipeline might look without a formatted pipe:

```
» ja [Mon..Wed] -> cat
["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

» ja [Mon..Wed] | cat
["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

» ja [Mon..Wed]
[
    "Mon",
    "Tue",
    "Wed"
]
```
