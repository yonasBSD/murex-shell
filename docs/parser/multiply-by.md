# `*=` Multiply By Operator

> Multiplies a variable by the right hand value (expression)

## Description

The Multiply By operator takes the value of the variable specified on the left
side of the operator and multiplies it with the value on the right hand side
Then it assigns the result back to the variable specified on the left side.

It is ostensibly just shorthand for `$i = $i * value`.

This operator is only available in expressions.



## Examples

```
» $i = 3
» $i *= 2
» $i
5
```

## Detail

### Strict Types

Unlike with the standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), silent data
casting isn't supported with arithmetic assignments like `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and
`/=`. Not even when `strict-types` is disabled ([read more](/docs/user-guide/strict-types.md))

You can work around this by using the slightly longer syntax: **variable =
value op value**, for example:

```
» $i = "3"
» $i = $i + "2"
» $i
5
```
