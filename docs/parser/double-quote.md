# `"Double Quote"`

> Initiates or terminates a string (variables expanded)

## Description

Double quote is used to initiate and terminate strict strings where variables
can be expanded.

Commands can also be quoted using double quotes (eg where a command might
contain a space character in it's name) however variables cannot be used as
part of a command name.



## Examples

```
» set: example="World!"

» out: "Hello $example"
Hello World!
```

## Detail

Quotes can also work over multiple lines

```
» out "foo
» bar"
foo
bar
```
