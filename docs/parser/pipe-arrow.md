# `->` Arrow Pipe

> Pipes stdout from the left hand command to stdin of the right hand command

## Description

This token behaves much like pipe would in Bash or similar shells. It passes
stdout along the pipeline while merging stderr stream with the parents stderr
stream.

`->` differs from `|` in the interactive terminal where it produces different
autocompletion suggestion. It returns a list of "methods". That is, commands
that are known to support the output type of the previous command. `->` helps
with the discovery of command line tools.

In shell scripts, `->` and `|` can be used interchangeably.



## Examples

### Piping stdout

```
» out Hello, world! -> regexp s/world/Earth/
Hello, Earth!

» out Hello, world!->regexp s/world/Earth/
Hello, Earth!
```

### Piping stderr

In following example the first command is writing to stderr rather than stdout
so `Hello, world!` doesn't get pipelined and thus isn't affected by `regexp`:

```
» err Hello, world! -> regexp s/world/Earth/
Hello, world!
```

To pipe stderr you'd need to use the `<!>` syntax. For example `<!out>` to
write stderr to stdout:

```
» err <!out> Hello, world! -> regexp s/world/Earth/
Hello, Earth!
```
