# `+=` Add With Operator

> Adds the right hand value to a variable (expression)

## Description

The Add With operator takes the value of the variable specified on the left
side of the operator and adds it with the value on the right hand side. Then
it assigns the result back to the variable specified on the left side.

It is ostensibly just shorthand for `$i = $i + value`.

This operator is only available in expressions.



## Examples

```
» $i = 3
» $i += 2
» $i
5
```

## Detail

### Strict Types

Unlike with the standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), silent data
casting isn't supported with arithmetic assignments like `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and
`/=`. Not even when `strict-types` is disabled ([read more](/docs/user-guide/strict-types.md))

You can work around this by using the slightly longer syntax: **variable =
value op value**, for example:

```
» $i = "3"
» $i = $i + "2"
» $i
5
```
