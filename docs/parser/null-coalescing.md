# `??` Null Coalescing Operator

> Returns the right operand if the left operand is empty / undefined (expression)

## Description

The Null Coalescing operator is a little like a conditional where the result of the
operation is the first non-empty value from left to right.

An empty value is any of the following:

* an unset / undefined variable
* any value with a `null` data type

Other "falsy" values such as numerical values of `0`, boolean `false`, zero
length strings and strings containing `"null"` are not considered empty by the
null coalescing operator.



## Examples

### Assign with a default value

```
» $foo = $bar ?? "baz"
```

If `$bar` is unset then the value of `$foo` will be **"baz"**.

### Multiple operators

```
» $unset_variable ?? null ?? "foobar"
foobar
```

## Detail

The following extract was taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator):

> The null coalescing operator (called the Logical Defined-Or operator in Perl)
> is a binary operator that is part of the syntax for a basic conditional
> expression in several programming languages. While its behavior differs
> between implementations, the null coalescing operator generally returns the
> result of its left-most operand if it exists and is not null, and otherwise
> returns the right-most operand. This behavior allows a default value to be
> defined for cases where a more specific value is not available.
>
> In contrast to the ternary conditional if operator used as `x ? x : y`, but
> like the binary Elvis operator used as `x ?: y`, the null coalescing operator
> is a binary operator and thus evaluates its operands at most once, which is
> significant if the evaluation of `x` has side-effects.
