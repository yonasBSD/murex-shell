# `&&` And Logical Operator

> Continues next operation if previous operation passes

## Description

When in the **normal** run mode (see "schedulers" link below) this will only
run the command on the right hand side if the command on the left hand side
does not error. Neither stdout nor stderr are piped.

This has no effect in `try` nor `trypipe` run modes because they automatically
apply stricter error handling.



## Examples

### When true

Second command runs because the first command doesn't error:

```
» out one && out two
one
two
```

When false

Second command does not run because the first command produces an error:

```
» err one && out two
one
```

## Detail

This is equivalent to a `try` block:

```
try {
    err one
    out two
}
```
