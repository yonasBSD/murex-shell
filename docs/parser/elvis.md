# `?:` Elvis Operator

> Returns the right operand if the left operand is falsy (expression)

## Description

The Elvis Operator is a little like a conditional where the result of the
operation is the first non-falsy value from left to right.

A falsy value is any of the following:

* an unset / undefined variable
* any value with a `null` data type
* a `str` or generic with the value `false`, `null`, `0`, `no`, `off`, `fail`,
  `failed`, or `disabled`
* a number (`num`, `float` or `int`) with the value `0`
* an empty object or zero length array 
* and, of course, a boolean with the value `false`



## Examples

### Assign with a default value

```
» $foo = $bar ?: "baz"
```

If `$bar` is falsy, then the value of `$foo` will be **"baz"**.

### Multiple elvis operators

```
» $unset_variable ?: null ?: false ?: "foobar"
foobar
```

## Detail

### Whats in a name?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_operator) explains this best
where it says:

> The name "Elvis operator" refers to the fact that when its common notation,
> `?:`, is viewed sideways, it resembles an emoticon of Elvis Presley with his
> signature hairstyle.
