# v7.1

This release focuses mainly on bugfixes and quality-of-life with the exception of three **experimental** new major additions: * `foreach` now supports running processes in parallel * `fanout` is a new builtin that allows sending stdout to the stdin of many processes * `md` is a new datatype added. Currently only supports rendering markdown tables but more features will follow in future releases
