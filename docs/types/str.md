# `str` (string)

> string (primitive)

## Description

This type is modelled closely on generic but is more tailored for textual
(non-tabulated) data.

## Supported Hooks

* `Marshal()`
    Supported
* `ReadArray()`
    Treats each new line as a new array element
* `ReadArrayWithType()`
    Treats each new line as a new array element, each array element is `str` 
* `ReadIndex()`
    Indexes treated as a new line separated list
* `ReadMap()`
    Treats each new line as a numbered map element
* `ReadNotIndex()`
    Indexes treated as a new line separated list
* `Unmarshal()`
    Supported
* `WriteArray()`
    Writes a new line per array element
