# `toml`

> Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language (TOML)

## Description

TOML support within Murex is pretty mature however it is not considered a
primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
expect in most deployments of Murex, it's still an optional package and
thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
external source packages for the shell to compile.

## Examples

Example TOML document taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML)

```
# This is a TOML document.

title = "TOML Example"

[owner]
name = "Tom Preston-Werner"
dob = 1979-05-27T07:32:00-08:00 # First class dates

[database]
server = "192.168.1.1"
ports = [ 8001, 8001, 8002 ]
connection_max = 5000
enabled = true

[servers]

  # Indentation (tabs and/or spaces) is allowed but not required
  [servers.alpha]
  ip = "10.0.0.1"
  dc = "eqdc10"

  [servers.beta]
  ip = "10.0.0.2"
  dc = "eqdc10"

[clients]
data = [ ["gamma", "delta"], [1, 2] ]

# Line breaks are OK when inside arrays
hosts = [
  "alpha",
  "omega"
]
```
