# mxjson

> Murex-flavoured JSON (deprecated)

## Description

> This format has been deprecated in favour of `%{}` constructors.

mxjson is an extension to JSON designed to integrate more seamlessly when
use as a configuration file. Thus mxjson supports comments and Murex code
blocks embedded into the JSON schema.

> mxjson is a format that is pre-parsed into a valid JSON format.

mxjson isn't a Murex data-type in that you cannot marshal
and unmarshal mxjson files. Currently it is a format that is only supported
by a small subset of Murex builtins (eg `config` and `autocomplete`) where
config might embed Murex code blocks.

**mxjson features the following enhancements:**

### Line Comments

Line comments are prefixed with a 'hash', `#`, just like with regular Murex
code.

### Block Quotation

Code blocks are quoted with `(`, `)`. For example, below "ExampleFunction"
uses the `({ block quote })` method.

```
{
    "ExampleFunction": ({
        out "This is an example Murex function"
        if { =1==2 } then {
            err "The laws of the universe are broken"
        }
    })
}
```

Any block quoted by this method will be converted to the following valid JSON:

```
{
    "ExampleFunction": "\n    out \"This is an example Murex function\"\n    if { =1==2 } then {\n        err \"The laws of the universe are broken\"\n    }"
}
```
