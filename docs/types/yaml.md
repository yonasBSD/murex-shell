# `yaml`

> YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)

## Description

YAML support within Murex is pretty mature however it is not considered a
primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
expect in most deployments of Murex, it's still an optional package and
thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
external source packages for the shell to compile.

## Default Associations

* **Extension**: `yaml`
* **Extension**: `yml`
* **MIME**: `+yaml`
* **MIME**: `application/x-yaml`
* **MIME**: `application/yaml`
* **MIME**: `text/x-yaml`
* **MIME**: `text/yaml`


## Supported Hooks

* `Marshal()`
    Supported
* `ReadArray()`
    Works with YAML arrays. Maps are converted into arrays
* `ReadArrayWithType()`
    Works with YAML arrays. Maps are converted into arrays. Element type returned in Murex should match element type in YAML
* `ReadIndex()`
    Works against all properties in YAML
* `ReadMap()`
    Works with YAML maps
* `ReadNotIndex()`
    Works against all properties in YAML
* `Unmarshal()`
    Supported
* `WriteArray()`
    Works with YAML arrays
