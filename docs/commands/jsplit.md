# String Split: `jsplit`

> Splits stdin into a JSON array based on a regex parameter

## Description

`jsplit` will read from stdin and split it based on a regex parameter. It outputs a JSON array.

## Usage

```
<stdin> -> jsplit regex -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

```
Â» (hello, world) -> jsplit l+ 
[
    "he",
    "o, wor",
    "d"
]
```

## Detail

`jsplit` will trim trailing carriage returns and line feeds from each element
as well as any trailing empty elements (zero length strings) in the JSON array.
However any empty elements will be retained and any other whitespace characters
- or carriage returns and/or line feeds in the middle of an element - will be
retained.

This is so that the formatting of (multiline) text is retained as much as
possible to ensure the `jsplit` is accurate while at the same time any commonly
unwanted "noise" is stripped from the output.
