# Read User Input: `read`

> `read` a line of input from the user and store as a variable

## Description

A readline function to allow a line of data inputed from the terminal.

## Usage

### Classic usage

read "prompt" var_name

<stdin> -> read var_name
```

### Script usage

```
read [ --prompt "prompt"         ]
     [ --variable var_name       ]
     [ --default "default value" ]
     [ --datatype data-type      ]
     [ --autocomplete { json }   ]
     [ --mask character          ]
```

## Examples

### Classic usage

```
read "What is your name? " name
out "Hello $name"

out What is your name? -> read name
out "Hello $name"
```

### Script usage

```
read --prompt "Are you sure? [Y/n]" \
      --variable yn \
      --default Y
```

### Secrets

```
read --prompt "Password: " --variable pw --mask *
```

## Flags

* `--autocomplete`
    Autocompletion suggestions. Can be either a JSON array or a JSON object
* `--datatype`
    Murex data-type for the read data (default: str)
* `--default`
    If a zero length string is returned but neither `ctrl`+`c` nor `ctrl`+`d` were pressed, then the default value defined here will be returned
* `--mask`
    Optional password mask, for reading secrets
* `--prompt`
    User notification to display
* `--variable`
    Variable name to store the read data (default: read)

## Detail

### Classic usage

If `read` is called as a method then the prompt string is taken from stdin.
Otherwise the prompt string will be the first parameter. However if no prompt
string is given then `read` will not write a prompt.

The last parameter will be the variable name to store the string read by `read`.
This variable cannot be prefixed by dollar, `$`, otherwise the shell will write
the output of that variable as the last parameter rather than the name of the
variable.

The data type the `read` line will be stored as is `str` (string). If you
require this to be different then please use `tread` (typed read) or call `read`
with the `--datatype` flag as per the **script usage**.
