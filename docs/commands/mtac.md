# Reverse Array (`mtac`)

> Reverse the order of an array

## Description

`mtac` takes input from stdin and reverses the order of it.

It's name is derived from a program called `tac` - a tool that functions
like `cat` but returns the contents in the reverse order. The difference
with the `mtac` builtin is that it is data-type aware. So it doesn't just
function as a replacement for `tac` but it also works on JSON arrays,
s-expressions, and any other data-type supporting arrays compiled into
Murex.

## Usage

```
<stdin> -> mtac -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

```
» ja [Monday..Friday] -> mtac
[
    "Friday",
    "Thursday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Monday"
]

# Normal output (without mtac)
» ja [Monday..Friday]
[
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday"
]
```

## Detail

Please bare in mind that while Murex is optimised with concurrency and
streaming in mind, it's impossible to reverse an incomplete array. Thus all
all of stdin must have been read and that file closed before `mtac` can
output.

In practical terms you shouldn't notice any difference except for when
stdin is a long running process or non-standard stream (eg network pipe).
