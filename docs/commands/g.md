# Globbing: `g`

> Glob pattern matching for file system objects (eg `*.txt`)

## Description

Returns a list of files and directories that match a glob pattern.

Output is a JSON list.

## Usage

```
g pattern -> <stdout>

!g pattern -> <stdout>

<stdin> -> g pattern -> <stdout>

<stdin> -> !g pattern -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

### Inline globbing

```
cat @{ g *.txt }
```

### Writing a JSON array of files to disk

```
g *.txt |> filelist.json
```

### Checking if a file exists

```
if { g somefile.txt } then {
    # file exists
}
```

### Checking if a file does not exist

```
!if { g somefile.txt } then {
    # file does not exist
}
```

### Return all files apart from

```
!g *.txt
```

### Filtering a file list based on glob matches

```
f +f -> g *.md
```

### Remove any glob matches from a file list

```
f +f -> !g *.md
```

### Files in directories that begin with a vowel

```
g [aeiou]*/*
```

## Detail

### Pattern Reference

Murex globbing is based on [Go's stdlib Match library](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match).

#### pattern

    { term }

#### term

    '*'         matches any sequence of non-Separator characters
    '?'         matches any single non-Separator character
    '[' [ '^' ] { character-range } ']'
                character class (must be non-empty)
    c           matches character c (c != '*', '?', '\\', '[')
    '\\' c      matches character c

#### character-range

    c           matches character c (c != '\\', '-', ']')
    '\\' c      matches character c
    lo '-' hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi

### Inverse Matches

If you want to exclude any matches based on wildcards, rather than include
them, then you can use the bang prefix. For example, here we use an asterisks
to exclude everything:

```
Â» !g *
Error in `!g` (1,1): No data returned.
```

### When Used As A Method

`!g` first looks for files that match its pattern, then it reads the file list
from stdin. If stdin contains contents that are not files then `!g` might not
handle those list items correctly. This shouldn't be an issue with `frx` in its
normal mode because it is only looking for matches however when used as `!g`
any items that are not files will leak through.

This is its designed feature and not a bug. If you wish to remove anything that
also isn't a file then you should first pipe into either `g *`, `rx .*`, or
`f +f` and then pipe that into `!g`.

The reason for this behavior is to separate this from `!regexp` and `!match`.
