# HTTP(S) Get Request: `get`

> Makes a standard HTTP request and returns the result as a JSON object

## Description

Fetches a page from a URL via HTTP/S GET request

## Usage

```
get url -> <stdout>

<stdin> -> get url -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

```
» get google.com -> [ Status ]
{
    "Code": 200,
    "Message": "OK"
}
```

## Detail

### JSON return

`get` returns a JSON object with the following fields:

```
{
    "Status": {
        "Code": integer,
        "Message": string,
    },
    "Headers": {
        string [
            string...
        ]
    },
    "Body": string
}
```

The concept behind this is it provides and easier path for scripting eg pulling
specific fields via the index, `[`, function.

### As A Method

Running `get`, `post` or `getfile` as a method will transmit the contents of
stdin as part of the body of the HTTP request. When run as a method the
`Content-Type` HTTP header will automatically be set to the default MIME for
the data type from stdin.

This is defined in `config`, pre-defined by sensible defaults from each murex
data type. For example:

```
» config get shell default-mimes -> [json]
application/json
```

You can override this at the global level via **shell default-mimes**, or at
the local level via **http headers**:

```
config set http headers %{
    api.example.com: {
        Content-Type: application/foobar
    }
}
```

### Configurable options

`get` has a number of behavioral options which can be configured via Murex's
standard `config` tool:

```
» config -> [ http ]
```

To change a default, for example the user agent string:

```
» config set http user-agent "bob"
» get google.com
```

This enables sane, repeatable and readable defaults. Read the documents on
`config` for more details about it's usage and the rational behind the command.
