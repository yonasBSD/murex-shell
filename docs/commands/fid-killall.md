# Kill All In Session: `fid-killall`

> Terminate all running Murex functions in current session

## Description

`fid-killall` will terminate **all** processes and Murex functions in the
current session.

## Usage

```
fid-killall
```

## Detail

`fid-killall` works by the same mechanisms as `fid-kill`, described below:

`fid-kill` doesn't send a kernel signal to the process since Murex is
a multi-threaded shell with a single signal, `fid-kill` will send a
cancellation context to any builtins executing (which covers builtins,
aliases, public and private functions and any external executables running
which were launched within the current Murex shell).

The FID (function ID) sent is not the same as a POSIX (eg Linux, macOS, BSD)
PID (process ID). You can obtain a FID from `fid-list`.
