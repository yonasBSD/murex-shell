# Regex Operations (`regexp`)

> Regexp tools for arrays / lists of strings

## Description

`regexp` provides a few tools for text matching and manipulation against an
array or list of strings - thus `regexp` is Murex data-type aware.

## Usage

```
<stdin> -> regexp expression -> <stdout>
```

Where _expression_ consists of the following

```
function separator pattern [ separator parameter2 ]
```

* _function_: single alphabetic character (eg, `m`, `s` or `f`)

* _separator_: typically a single unicode character (eg, `/`, `#`, `â–·`, `ðŸ™‚`)
  however `regexp` _parameters_ can also be passed as shell parameters (eg
  `s search replace`)

* _pattern_: regexp pattern

* _parameter2_: any extra operations to perform. For example a string to
  replace matched patterns when using the regexp substitution function

## Examples

### Find elements

```
Â» ja [monday..sunday] -> regexp 'f/^([a-z]{3})day/'
[
    "mon",
    "fri",
    "sun"
]
```

This returns only 3 days because only 3 days match the expression (where
the days have to be 6 characters long) and then it only returns the first 3
characters because those are inside the parenthesis.

### Match elements

#### Elements containing

```
Â» ja [monday..sunday] -> regexp 'm/(mon|fri|sun)day/'
[
    "monday",
    "friday",
    "sunday"
]
```

#### Elements excluding

```
Â» ja [monday..sunday] -> !regexp 'm/(mon|fri|sun)day/'
[
    "tuesday",
    "wednesday",
    "thursday",
    "saturday"
]
```

#### Include heading

```
Â» ps -fe -> regexp 'M/murex/'
UID   PID  PPID   C STIME   TTY           TIME CMD
501 39631 39630   0  6:48pm ??         0:04.31 -murex
501 57496 17220   0 11:59pm ??         0:02.90 ./murex
501 41982 17219   0 10:53pm ttys000    0:39.73 -murex
501 17220 17219   0  2:09pm ttys002    1:44.06 -murex 
```

### Substitute expression

```
Â» ja [monday..sunday] -> regexp 's/day/night/'
[
    "monnight",
    "tuesnight",
    "wednesnight",
    "thursnight",
    "frinight",
    "saturnight",
    "sunnight"
]
```

## Flags

* `M`
    output first element (eg table headings), followed by any elements that match (supports bang prefix)
* `f`
    output found expressions (doesn't support bang prefix)
* `m`
    output elements that match expression (supports bang prefix)
* `s`
    output all elements, substituting elements that match expression (doesn't support bang prefix)

## Detail

### Data Types

`regexp` is data-type aware so will work against lists or arrays of whichever
Murex data-type is passed to it via stdin and return the output in the
same data-type.

### Inverse Matches

If you want to exclude any matches based on wildcards, rather than include
them, then you can use the bang prefix. For example if you wanted to exclude
any days of the week that contained the letter `s`:

```
Â» %[Monday..Friday] -> !regexp m/s/
[
    "Monday",
    "Friday"
]
```

## Expression Syntax

Murex regex expressions are based on [Go's stdlib regexp library](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp).

> The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the same general syntax
> used by Perl, Python, and other languages. More precisely, it is the syntax
> accepted by RE2 and described at https://golang.org/s/re2syntax, except for
> `\C`.
>
> The regexp implementation provided by this package is guaranteed to run in
> time linear in the size of the input. (This is a property not guaranteed by
> most open source implementations of regular expressions.) For more
> information about this property, see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html
> or any book about automata theory.
>
> All characters are UTF-8-encoded code points. Each byte of an invalid UTF-8
> sequence is treated as if it encoded as **U+FFFD**. 

### Single characters

    .              any character, possibly including newline (flag s=true)
    [xyz]          character class
    [^xyz]         negated character class
    \d             Perl character class
    \D             negated Perl character class
    [[:alpha:]]    ASCII character class
    [[:^alpha:]]   negated ASCII character class
    \pN            Unicode character class (one-letter name)
    \p{Greek}      Unicode character class
    \PN            negated Unicode character class (one-letter name)
    \P{Greek}      negated Unicode character class

### Composites

    xy             x followed by y
    x|y            x or y (prefer x)

### Repetitions

    x*             zero or more x, prefer more
    x+             one or more x, prefer more
    x?             zero or one x, prefer one
    x{n,m}         n or n+1 or ... or m x, prefer more
    x{n,}          n or more x, prefer more
    x{n}           exactly n x
    x*?            zero or more x, prefer fewer
    x+?            one or more x, prefer fewer
    x??            zero or one x, prefer zero
    x{n,m}?        n or n+1 or ... or m x, prefer fewer
    x{n,}?         n or more x, prefer fewer
    x{n}?          exactly n x

#### Implementation restriction

The counting forms `x{n,m}`, `x{n,}`, and `x{n}` reject forms that create a
minimum or maximum repetition count above 1000. Unlimited repetitions are not
subject to this restriction.

### Grouping

    (re)           numbered capturing group (submatch)
    (?P<name>re)   named & numbered capturing group (submatch)
    (?<name>re)    named & numbered capturing group (submatch)
    (?:re)         non-capturing group
    (?flags)       set flags within current group; non-capturing
    (?flags:re)    set flags during re; non-capturing

    Flag syntax is xyz (set) or -xyz (clear) or xy-z (set xy, clear z). The flags are:

    i              case-insensitive (default false)
    m              multi-line mode: ^ and $ match begin/end line in addition to begin/end text (default false)
    s              let . match \n (default false)
    U              ungreedy: swap meaning of x* and x*?, x+ and x+?, etc (default false)

### Empty strings

    ^              at beginning of text or line (flag m=true)
    $              at end of text (like \z not \Z) or line (flag m=true)
    \A             at beginning of text
    \b             at ASCII word boundary (\w on one side and \W, \A, or \z on the other)
    \B             not at ASCII word boundary
