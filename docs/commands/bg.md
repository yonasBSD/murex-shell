# Background Process: `bg`

> Run processes in the background

## Description

`bg` supports two modes: it can either be run as a function block which will
execute in the background, or it can take stopped processes and daemonize
them.

## Usage

POSIX only:

 ```
 bg { code block }

 bg fid
 ```

## Examples


```
bg { sleep 5; out "Morning" }
```

## Detail

The examples above will work on any system (Windows included). However the
`ctrl+z` usage of backgrounding a stopped process (like Bash) is only
supported on POSIX systems due to the limitation of required signals on
non-platforms. This means the usage described in the examples is cross
cross platform while `bg int` currently does not work on Windows nor Plan 9.
