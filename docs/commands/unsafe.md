# Disable Error Handling In Block: `unsafe`

> Execute a block of code, always returning a zero exit number

## Description

`unsafe` is similar to normal execution except that the exit number for the
last function in the `unsafe` block is ignored. `unsafe` always returns `0`.

This is useful in any situations where you might want errors ignored.

## Usage

```
unsafe { code-block } -> <stdout>

<stdin> -> unsafe { -> code-block } -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

```
try {
    unsafe { err "foobar" }
    out "This message still displays because the error is inside an `unsafe` block"
}
```
