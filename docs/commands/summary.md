# Set Command Summary Hint: `summary`

> Defines a summary help text for a command

## Description

`summary` define help text for a command. This is effectively like a tooltip
message that appears, by default, in blue in the interactive shell.

Normally this text is populated from the `man` pages or `murex-docs`, however
if neither exist or if you wish to override their text, then you can use
`summary` to define that text.

## Usage

### Define a commands summary

```
summary command description
```

### Undefine a summary

```
!summary command
```

## Examples

### Define a commands summary

```
» summary foobar "Hello, world!"
» runtime --summaries -> [ foobar ]
Hello, world! 
```

### Undefine a summary

```
» !summary foobar
```
