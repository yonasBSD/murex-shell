# Processes Execution Time: `time`

## Description

`time` is an optional builtin which runs a command or block of code and
returns it's running time.

## Usage

```
time command parameters -> <stderr>

time { code-block } -> <stderr>
```

## Examples

### Time a command

```
» time sleep 5
5.000151513
```

## Detail

`time`'s output is written to stderr. However any output and errors written
by the commands executed by time will also be written to `time`'s stdout
and stderr as usual.
