# Variable And Config Scoping

> How scoping works within Murex

## Description

A _scope_ in Murex is a collection of code blocks to which variables and
config are persistent within. In Murex, a variable declared inside an `if` or
`foreach` block will be persistent outside of their blocks as long as you're
still inside the same function.

For example lets start with the following function that sets a variable called
**foo**

```
function example {
    if { true } then { set foo=bar }
    out $foo
}
```

In here the value is getting set inside an `if` block but its value is is
retrieved outside of that block. `out` and `set` have different parents but
the same _scoping_.

Then lets set **foo** outside of that function and see what happens:

```
» set foo=oof
» $foo
oof

» example
bar

» $foo
oof
```

Despite setting a variable named **foo**, the value inside **example** does not
overwrite the value outside **example** because they occupy different _scoping_.

## What Instantiates A New Scope?

A new _scope_ is instantiated by anything which resembles a function. This
would be code inside events, dynamic autocompletes, open agents, any code
blocks defined in `config`, as well as public and private functions too.

Code inside an `if`, `switch`, `foreach` and `source` do not create a new
_scope_. Sub-shells also do not create a new _scope_ either.
