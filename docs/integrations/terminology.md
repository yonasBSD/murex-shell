# Terminology Integrations

> Get more out of Terminology terminal emulator

## Description

Terminology it a cross platform terminal emulator. It supports several ANSI
escape codes that are bespoke to Terminology.

Murex can detect if it is running on Terminology and utilise those exclusive
ANSI escape codes, so you don't have to remember different ways of working with
different terminal emulators.

## Opening Images

Using [`open`](/docs/commands/open.md), you can render an image directly in the
terminal. Normally that would be a blocky "pixellated" representation using
block characters. But if you're running Terminology, Murex will automatically
switch to Terminology's ANSI escape sequences to render those images
beautifully.
