# `direnv` Integrations

> Directory specific environmental variables

## Description

From `direnv`'s [Github README](https://github.com/direnv/direnv):

> `direnv` is an extension for your shell. It augments existing shells with a
> new feature that can load and unload environment variables depending on the
> current directory.

While this functionality isn't built into the core of Murex, `direnv` has
added their own hook to support Murex.

More details can be found on their [hook.md](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/docs/hook.md#murex)
document.
