# `yarn` Integrations

> Working with `yarn` and `package.json`

## Description

`yarn` is a common tool for working with `package.json`. Some developers use
this almost like a `Makefile`.

Murex comes with some handy autocompletions out-of-the-box for working with
`yarn` in the command line.

## Autocompletions

Custom [autocomplete](/docs/commands/autocomplete.md) rules exist for `yarn` which will
not only include any `yarn` specific flags, but also include any parameters
defined in your `package.json` too.

## Source Code

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/blob/master/integrations/yarn_any.mx)
under `/integrations`.
