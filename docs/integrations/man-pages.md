# Man Pages (POSIX)

> Linux/UNIX `man` page integrations

## Description

`man` page parsing is used extensively throughout Murex. From providing default
autocompletions through to quick access of those manuals via the `[f1]` preview
pane.

This document describes the various different integrations around those `man`
pages.

> Please note that this is only supported on Linux, macOS, BSD and other
> UNIX-like platforms. Windows and Plan 9 do not currently support these
> specific integrations.

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete, sometimes referred to as "tab-completion", are command and
parameter suggestions offered when you press `[tab]`.

A lot of commands will have a bespoke [autocomplete config](/docs/commands/autocomplete.md)
defined for them. However writing autocomplete rules for every command out
there would be hugely time consuming and impractical. Thus **Murex can
automatically generate autocompletions** based on the contents of a commands
`man` page.

## Preview

If you want to quickly read a `man` page without disrupting your flow in the
command line, then you can press `[f1]` to preview it.

This preview will allow you to keep typing out your command line while also
presenting the `man` page in an easy to read layout.

## Summary

When you type a command in, you will see a brief description of what that
command is, in your [hint text](/docs/user-guide/interactive-shell.md#hint-text).
That command will generally be pulled from its accompanying `man` page.
