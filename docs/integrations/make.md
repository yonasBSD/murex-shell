# Makefiles / `make`

> `make` integrations

## Description

`Makefiles` can sometimes be hard to grok. So Murex provides out-of-the-box
support to make working with `make` a little easier.

## Autocompletions

Custom [autocomplete](/docs/commands/autocomplete.md) rules exist for `make` which will
not only include any `make` specific flags, but also include any parameters
defined in your `Makefile` too.

## Preview

If you press `[f1]` with your command as `make`, and you have a `Makefile` in
your current working directory, then you will be presented with a preview of
your `Makefile`.

## Source Code

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/blob/master/integrations/make_posix.mx)
under `/integrations`.
